    <p class="respond134">“Angelika has been my therapist for over two and half years.
        She has been my rock through some of the worst moments in my
        life. She is kind and compassionate, but she will also challenge
        you to self-assess and consider areas of growth. She has helped
         me come to major self-realisations, begin processing childhood 
         trauma, navigate an extreme mental health crisis, and start to 
         shape a new life for myself. Angelika is a dynamic therapist who 
         is is keen to support you in whatever way will most help you. 
         She doesn’t have ‘one size fits all approach’ but rather is c
         onstantly working with you to shape her support so that therapy 
         is a space in which you can heal and grow. I would highly 
         recommend Angelika as a therapist.”</p>
